* Finished analyzing classpath
* Generating tests for class org.apache.commons.math.distribution.FDistributionImpl
* Test criterion:
  - Branch Coverage
* Setting up search algorithm for whole suite generation
* Total number of test goals: 17
* Using seed 1536378024030
* Starting evolution
* Search finished after 6s and 1 generations, 1083 statements, best individual has fitness: 0.0
* Minimizing test suite
* Coverage analysis for criterion BRANCH
* Coverage of criterion BRANCH: 100%
* Total number of goals: 17
* Number of covered goals: 17
* Generated 10 tests with total length 19
* Resulting test suite's coverage: 100%
* GA-Budget:
	- ZeroFitness :                      0 / 0            Finished!
	- RMIStoppingCondition
