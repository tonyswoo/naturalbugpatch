* Total number of test goals: 16
* Using seed 1536376453239
* Starting evolution
* Search finished after 1801s and 20701 generations, 4458843 statements, best individual has fitness: 16.0
* Minimizing test suite
* Coverage analysis for criterion BRANCH
* Coverage of criterion BRANCH: 12%
* Total number of goals: 16
* Number of covered goals: 2
* Generated 2 tests with total length 2
* Resulting test suite's coverage: 12%
* GA-Budget:
