* Finished analyzing classpath
* Generating tests for class org.apache.commons.math.fraction.BigFraction
* Test criterion:
  - Branch Coverage
* Setting up search algorithm for whole suite generation
* Total number of test goals: 131
* Using seed 1536369827811
* Starting evolution
* Search finished after 1931s and 7 generations, 7097 statements, best individual has fitness: 3.5
* Minimizing test suite
* Coverage analysis for criterion BRANCH
* Coverage of criterion BRANCH: 95%
* Total number of goals: 131
* Number of covered goals: 124
* Generated 59 tests with total length 124
* Resulting test suite's coverage: 95%
* GA-Budget:
