* EvoSuite 
* Going to generate test cases for class: org.apache.commons.math3.random.BitsStreamGenerator
* Starting client
* Connecting to master process on port 21446
* Analyzing classpath: 
  - /tmp/run_evosuite.pl_29936_1536367011/target/classes
* Finished analyzing classpath
* Generating tests for class org.apache.commons.math3.random.BitsStreamGenerator
* Test criterion:
  - Branch Coverage
* Setting up search algorithm for whole suite generation
* Total number of test goals: 20
* Using seed 1536367039328
* Starting evolution
* Search finished after 17s and 40 generations, 35920 statements, best individual has fitness: 0.0
* Minimizing test suite
* Coverage analysis for criterion BRANCH
* Coverage of criterion BRANCH: 100%
* Total number of goals: 20
* Number of covered goals: 20
* Generated 10 tests with total length 22
* Resulting test suite's coverage: 100%
* GA-Budget:
	- RMIStoppingCondition
	- ShutdownTestWriter :               0 / 0           
	- ZeroFitness :                      0 / 0            Finished!
	- MaxTime :                         17 / 1,800       
* Time spent executing tests: 11898ms
* Generating assertions
* Resulting test suite's mutation score: 63%
* Writing JUnit test case 'BitsStreamGenerator_ESTest' to evosuite-branch
* Done!

* Computation finished
