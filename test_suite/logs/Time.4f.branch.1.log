* Search finished after 1802s and 13636 generations, 1856066 statements, best individual has fitness: 1.0
* Minimizing test suite
* Coverage analysis for criterion BRANCH
* Coverage of criterion BRANCH: 99%
* Total number of goals: 134
* Number of covered goals: 132
* Generated 50 tests with total length 212
* Resulting test suite's coverage: 99%
