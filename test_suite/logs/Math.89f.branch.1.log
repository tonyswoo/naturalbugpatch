* Search finished after 1802s and 6183 generations, 650467 statements, best individual has fitness: 2.0
* Minimizing test suite
* Coverage analysis for criterion BRANCH
* Coverage of criterion BRANCH: 95%
* Total number of goals: 55
* Number of covered goals: 52
* Generated 22 tests with total length 57
* Resulting test suite's coverage: 95%
* GA-Budget:
