* Finished analyzing classpath
* Generating tests for class org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.MultivariateNormalDistribution
* Test criterion:
  - Branch Coverage
* Setting up search algorithm for whole suite generation
* Total number of test goals: 31
* Using seed 1536367016539
* Starting evolution
* Search finished after 17s and 118 generations, 68783 statements, best individual has fitness: 0.0
* Minimizing test suite
* Coverage analysis for criterion BRANCH
* Coverage of criterion BRANCH: 100%
* Total number of goals: 31
* Number of covered goals: 31
* Generated 8 tests with total length 50
* Resulting test suite's coverage: 100%
* GA-Budget:
