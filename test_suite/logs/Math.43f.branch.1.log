* Finished analyzing classpath
* Generating tests for class org.apache.commons.math.stat.descriptive.SummaryStatistics
* Test criterion:
  - Branch Coverage
* Setting up search algorithm for whole suite generation
* Total number of test goals: 91
* Using seed 1536371075952
* Starting evolution
* Search finished after 100s and 1137 generations, 242528 statements, best individual has fitness: 0.0
* Minimizing test suite
* Coverage analysis for criterion BRANCH
* Coverage of criterion BRANCH: 100%
* Total number of goals: 91
* Number of covered goals: 91
* Generated 35 tests with total length 123
* Resulting test suite's coverage: 100%
* GA-Budget:
	- ZeroFitness :                      0 / 0            Finished!
	- MaxTime :                        103 / 1,800
