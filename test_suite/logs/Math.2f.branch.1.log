* Going to generate test cases for class: org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.HypergeometricDistribution
* Starting client
* Connecting to master process on port 21355
* Analyzing classpath: 
  - /tmp/run_evosuite.pl_7460_1536366035/target/classes
* Finished analyzing classpath
* Generating tests for class org.apache.commons.math3.distribution.HypergeometricDistribution
* Test criterion:
  - Branch Coverage
* Setting up search algorithm for whole suite generation
* Total number of test goals: 38
* Using seed 1536366061293
* Starting evolution
* Search finished after 7s and 1 generations, 2656 statements, best individual has fitness: 0.0
* Minimizing test suite
* Coverage analysis for criterion BRANCH
* Coverage of criterion BRANCH: 100%
* Total number of goals: 38
* Number of covered goals: 38
* Generated 14 tests with total length 30
* Resulting test suite's coverage: 100%
* GA-Budget:
	- ZeroFitness :                      0 / 0            Finished!
	- ShutdownTestWriter :               0 / 0
