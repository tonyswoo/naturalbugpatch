* EvoSuite 
* Going to generate test cases for class: org.apache.commons.math.analysis.solvers.UnivariateRealSolverUtils
* Starting client
* Connecting to master process on port 21190
* Analyzing classpath: 
  - /tmp/run_evosuite.pl_15406_1536376572/target/classes
* Finished analyzing classpath
* Generating tests for class org.apache.commons.math.analysis.solvers.UnivariateRealSolverUtils
* Test criterion:
  - Branch Coverage
* Setting up search algorithm for whole suite generation
* Total number of test goals: 26
* Using seed 1536376596626
* Starting evolution
* Search finished after 6s and 1 generations, 5616 statements, best individual has fitness: 0.0
* Minimizing test suite
* Coverage analysis for criterion BRANCH
* Coverage of criterion BRANCH: 100%
* Total number of goals: 26
* Number of covered goals: 26
* Generated 11 tests with total length 30
* Resulting test suite's coverage: 100%
* GA-Budget:
	- ZeroFitness :                      0 / 0            Finished!
	- ShutdownTestWriter :               0 / 0           
	- RMIStoppingCondition
	- MaxTime :                          7 / 1,800       
* Time spent executing tests: 4213ms
* Generating assertions
* Resulting test suite's mutation score: 36%
* Writing JUnit test case 'UnivariateRealSolverUtils_ESTest' to evosuite-branch
* Done!
