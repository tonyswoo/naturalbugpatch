* Starting evolution
* Search finished after 136s and 1624 generations, 219666 statements, best individual has fitness: 0.0
* Minimizing test suite
* Coverage analysis for criterion BRANCH
* Coverage of criterion BRANCH: 100%
* Total number of goals: 23
* Number of covered goals: 23
* Generated 11 tests with total length 22
* Resulting test suite's coverage: 100%
* GA-Budget:
