* Generating tests for class org.apache.commons.math.stat.regression.SimpleRegression
* Test criterion:
  - Branch Coverage
* Setting up search algorithm for whole suite generation
* Total number of test goals: 33
* Using seed 1536379142984
* Starting evolution
* Search finished after 6s and 5 generations, 7619 statements, best individual has fitness: 0.0
* Minimizing test suite
* Coverage analysis for criterion BRANCH
* Coverage of criterion BRANCH: 100%
* Total number of goals: 33
* Number of covered goals: 33
* Generated 14 tests with total length 45
* Resulting test suite's coverage: 100%
