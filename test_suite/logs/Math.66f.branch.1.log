* Total number of test goals: 57
* Using seed 1536373745787
* Starting evolution
* Search finished after 39s and 430 generations, 122201 statements, best individual has fitness: 0.0
* Minimizing test suite
* Coverage analysis for criterion BRANCH
* Coverage of criterion BRANCH: 100%
* Total number of goals: 57
* Number of covered goals: 57
* Generated 8 tests with total length 55
* Resulting test suite's coverage: 100%
* GA-Budget:
	- MaxTime :                         40 / 1,800
