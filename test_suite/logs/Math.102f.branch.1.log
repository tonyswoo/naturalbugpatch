* Analyzing classpath: 
  - /tmp/run_evosuite.pl_28499_1536378916/target/classes
* Finished analyzing classpath
* Generating tests for class org.apache.commons.math.stat.inference.ChiSquareTestImpl
* Test criterion:
  - Branch Coverage
* Setting up search algorithm for whole suite generation
* Total number of test goals: 99
* Using seed 1536378941416
* Starting evolution
* Search finished after 70s and 885 generations, 453039 statements, best individual has fitness: 0.0
* Minimizing test suite
* Coverage analysis for criterion BRANCH
* Coverage of criterion BRANCH: 100%
* Total number of goals: 99
* Number of covered goals: 99
* Generated 27 tests with total length 144
* Resulting test suite's coverage: 100%
* GA-Budget:
	- ShutdownTestWriter :               0 / 0           
	- ZeroFitness :                      0 / 0            Finished!
	- MaxTime :                         72 / 1,800
