* Generating tests for class org.apache.commons.lang3.text.translate.EntityArrays
* Test criterion:
  - Branch Coverage
* Setting up search algorithm for whole suite generation
* Total number of test goals: 13
* Using seed 1536360878177
* Starting evolution
* Search finished after 5s and 0 generations, 8486 statements, best individual has fitness: 0.0
* Minimizing test suite
* Coverage analysis for criterion BRANCH
* Coverage of criterion BRANCH: 100%
* Total number of goals: 13
* Number of covered goals: 13
* Generated 11 tests with total length 12
* Resulting test suite's coverage: 100%
* GA-Budget:
