* Starting evolution
* Search finished after 183s and 3473 generations, 183418 statements, best individual has fitness: 0.0
* Minimizing test suite
* Coverage analysis for criterion BRANCH
* Coverage of criterion BRANCH: 73%
* Total number of goals: 73
* Number of covered goals: 53
* Generated 24 tests with total length 59
* Resulting test suite's coverage: 100%
* GA-Budget:
