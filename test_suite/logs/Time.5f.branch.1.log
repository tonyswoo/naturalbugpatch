* Finished analyzing classpath
* Generating tests for class org.joda.time.Period
* Test criterion:
  - Branch Coverage
* Setting up search algorithm for whole suite generation
* Total number of test goals: 131
* Using seed 1536383316233
* Starting evolution
* Search finished after 56s and 355 generations, 96506 statements, best individual has fitness: 0.0
* Minimizing test suite
* Coverage analysis for criterion BRANCH
* Coverage of criterion BRANCH: 100%
* Total number of goals: 131
* Number of covered goals: 131
* Generated 69 tests with total length 189
* Resulting test suite's coverage: 100%
* GA-Budget:
	- MaxTime :                         61 / 1,800       
	- ShutdownTestWriter :               0 / 0           
	- ZeroFitness :                      0 / 0            Finished!
