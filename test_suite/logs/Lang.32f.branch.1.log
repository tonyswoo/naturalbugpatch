* Search finished after 1802s and 24460 generations, 10276109 statements, best individual has fitness: 1.0
* Minimizing test suite
* Coverage analysis for criterion BRANCH
* Coverage of criterion BRANCH: 94%
* Total number of goals: 119
* Number of covered goals: 112
* Generated 30 tests with total length 85
* Resulting test suite's coverage: 98%
* GA-Budget:
